# Servo Control Plugin

This Plugin provides control of a Servo motor connected to your Raspberry Pi via a configurable GPIO pin. 
You can set the Target Angle and optional the orientation and Image Inversion saved in device_config.
Mainly this Plugin is intended to be used together with the Rotating Image Frame to create a physical frame rotation when displaying images.
But it could also be used for controlling other Mechanics (e.g. Windscreen Wipers, Blinds, etc.).
